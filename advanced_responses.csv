2024-10-01 10:11:06,What is AI?,"AI stands for Artificial Intelligence, which refers to machines or software systems that mimic human intelligence and cognitive functions such as learning (machine learning), problem-solving, decision making, perception (vision processing) etc. These AI applications can be found in various fields like autonomous vehicles, healthcare diagnostics, natural language processing for chatbots among others."
2024-10-01 11:10:18,What is ML?,"Machine Learning (ML) refers to a field within artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems capable of learning from data, identifying patterns and making decisions with minimal human intervention. It combines methods based upon the mathematics of probability and statistics along with algorithms derived from computer science fields such as computational complexity theory, linear algebra, numerical analysis, statistics, artificial intelligence, graphics, philosophy etc., to enable computers to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence, like visual perception, speech recognition or decision-making. ML is widely used in areas ranging from medical diagnosis and drug development research through customer relationship management (CRM) systems and finance/banking applications to autonomous driving vehicles' computer vision system which interprets the world around it by analyzing real time camera data feeds, making decisions about what goes into its memory database."
2024-10-01 11:12:01,What is ML?,"Machine learning (ML) refers to a field within artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. It involves algorithms called models or neural networks which improve their performance over time as they are exposed to more training examples."
