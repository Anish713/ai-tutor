2024-09-28 19:21:34,What is AI?,"AI stands for Artificial Intelligence. It involves creating intelligent entities (or agents) capable of perceiving, reasoning, problem-solving, planning actions towards a goal autonomously in dynamic environments. These AI systems are structured with components like sensors that allow them to interact and operate within their environment effectively without human intervention for every task they perform."
2024-09-30 11:49:20,What is AI?,"AI is an acronym for Artificial Intelligence which refers specifically to a particular field in computer science focused on creating machines with intelligent behavior, such as learning from experience or solving problems using prior knowledge. The concept of intelligence involves the ability to think and act rationally by reacting appropriately when changes occur within one's environment while planning steps for achieving desired outcomes.

An AI agent is a system designed based on this field that can perceive, reason about its surroundings in dynamic environments autonomously make decisions solve problems to accomplish goals and interact with the world as if it were human-like intelligence or Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Such agents are composed of interconnected components like sensors for perception.
AI is not yet capable of achieving AGI, which would involve systems exhibiting full spectrums of human cognition including abstraction strategy imagination and consciousness."
2024-09-30 11:53:16,what is ML?,"Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that utilizes statistical algorithms to learn from data, improve performance without explicit programming for each task or situation. It involves the machine finding correlations between inputs and outputs (or even just input) in order to predict future unseen data based on learned rules independently of human intervention. There are different types within ML such as Supervised Learning which requires labeled datasets with both input-output pairs, while Deep Learning is a type that uses neural networks for feature extraction among complex features recognition and Data Science employs various algorithms from ML to analyze patterns in data for confident predictions."
