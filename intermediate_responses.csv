2024-09-28 19:26:05,What is ML?,"The term ""ML"" typically stands for Machine Learning, which refers to a field within Artificial Intelligence that uses statistical techniques and algorithms in order to give computers the ability to learn from data. By analyzing input data (like text or images), machine learning models can make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed with specific rules on how they're doing it, which is crucial for many applications like self-driving cars, recommendation systems and voice recognition in devices such as smartphones, speakers etc."
