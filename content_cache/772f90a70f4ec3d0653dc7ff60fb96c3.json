"In the realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the concept of \"agents\" is fundamental, serving as the cornerstone for creating machines that can perceive, reason, and act autonomously within dynamic environments. An AI agent is essentially a system designed to interact with its environment with a specific purpose in mind, composed of several interconnected components, each with a critical role to play.\n\n### The Structure of an AI Agent\n\n#### Sensors\nSensors act as the agent's windows to the world. They are the components that allow the AI agent to perceive its environment. This could include cameras, microphones, or other devices that gather data from the environment. The data collected by these sensors are then processed to help the AI agent understand its surr)\n\nIn the realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the concept of \"agents\" serves as the bedrock upon which we build machines capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting in dynamic environments. These AI agents represent a fundamental paradigm, breathing life into systems by enabling them to not only respond to stimuli but also to make decisions, solve problems, and achieve goals autonomously. In this introduction, we embark on a journey to understand the intricate world of AI agents, exploring their underlying structure, diverse types, and wide-ranging applications across domains.\n\n### The Structure of an AI Agent\n\n#### Sensors\nAt its core, an AI agent is a system designed to interact with its surroundings with a specific purpose in mind. It is a composition of several interconnected components, each with a critical role to play:\n\n- **Sensors**: These act as the agent\u2019s windows to the world. Whether in the form of cameras, microphones, or other devices, sensors are crucial for gathering data from the environment. This data is then processed to help the AI agent understand its surroundings and make informed decisions.\n\n### Types of AI Agents\n\n#### Expert Systems\nAn expert system is a computer system that emulates the decision-making ability of human experts. It consists of a knowledge base (collection of facts and data about a domain), an inference engine (to make decisions), and a user interface (to take inputs and give outputs). Expert systems are designed to offer advice or make decisions in mainly specialized fields like medicine, finance, or law.\n\n#### Machine Learning Algorithms\nMachine Learning (ML) is a branch of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. ML algorithms are used to find the correlation between inputs and outputs or inputs only, and those correlations are used to predict outputs based on different data. This approach allows AI systems to improve their performance over time as they are exposed to more data.\n\n#### Cognitive Modeling\nAccording to the cognitive modeling approach, AI is something that thinks like a real human being. To understand human feelings and behaviors, we have to first figure out how human thinks. This approach combines computer models from AI with experimental techniques from cognitive science to create AI systems that can mimic human thought processes.\n\n### Additional Resources\n\n#### Books\n- **Chapter 1: What Is AI?** from \"Artific[...]"
