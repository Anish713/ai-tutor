"\nIn step 6 of the AI tutorial, we're going to delve into the concept of Neural Networks, which are a cornerstone of modern AI. Neural Networks are inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. They are composed of interconnected nodes, or \"neurons,\" which process data in a manner somewhat analogous to how neurons in the human brain process information.\n\n\nA Neural Network consists of layers: an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each neuron in one layer is connected to neurons in the next layer through weighted connections. These weights are adjusted during the training process to minimize the difference between the actual output and the predicted output, a process known as learning.\n\n\nThe learning process involves feeding the network with training data, which consists of input-output pairs. The network makes predictions based on the inputs, and the error is calculated by comparing the predictions to the actual outputs. The network then adjusts its weights to reduce this error, a process that's repeated over many iterations or epochs.\n\n\nOne of the most popular types of Neural Networks is the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). An MLP is a feedforward neural network, meaning that the connections between the nodes do not form a cycle. MLPs are trained using a method called backpropagation, which efficiently computes the gradient of the error function with respect to the network's weights.\n\n\nIn the context of AI, Neural Networks are used for a variety of tasks, such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and even playing complex games like Go. The strength of Neural Networks lies in their ability to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task.\n\n\nTo summarize, Neural Networks are a powerful tool in AI, capable of learning from data and making complex decisions. They are composed of layers of neurons with weighted connections that are adjusted during the training process to minimize prediction errors."
